# Enhanced Mars Rover Kata

Youâ€™re part of the team that explores Mars by sending remotely controlled vehicles to the surface of the planet.
Implement an application that simulates the movement of a rover on a planet with data provided by user.

NOTE: for each version try to first model all functions signatures (use ??? marker) and then implement them. The idea is
to get a quick and cheap responsibility distribution phase.

For a full kata explanation see: https://kata-log.rocks/mars-rover-kata

## Data

- The planet is divided into a grid with x (width) and y (height) size.
- There are many obstacles on the planet. An obstacle has a position expressed as x, y co-ordinates.
- The rover has a position expressed as x, y co-ordinates and an orientation (North, Est, West, South).
- The rover can handle four command types: turn left or right, move forward or backward.

## V1 - Focus on the center (pure domain logic)

Develop an API (types and functions) that executes commands:

- Implement all commands logic.
- Commands are sent in batch and executed sequentially.
- The planet grid has a wrapping effect from one edge to another (pacman).
- For now, ignore obstacle detection logic

## V2 - Focus on boundaries (from primitive types to domain types and viceversa)

Our domain is declared with rich types but inputs/outputs are should be primitive types

- Write a parser for input planet data (size, obstacles)
- Write a parser for input rover data (position, orientation)
- Write a parser for input commands (skip unknown chars)
- Render the final result as string: "positionX:positionY:orientation"

## V3 - More domain logic (effect in domain logic)

Extend the API and it's implementation to handle obstacle detection:

- If a given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, the rover moves up to the last possible point and aborts the sequence.
- Render the final result as string:
  - normal: "positionX:positionY:orientation"
  - when hit obstacle "O:positionX:positionY:orientation"

## V4 - Focus on infrastructure (compose I/O operations)

Extend the "pure" way of work also to the infrastructural layer

- Read planet data from file into IO (size and obstacles)
- Read rover from file into IO (position and direction)
- Read commands from console into IO
- Implement an application service (encapsulate application logic) that:
  - orchestrate domain, infrastructure, parsing and error handling
  - run the whole app lifted in the IO monad
  - print final rover output to the console if everything is ok
  - handle, safely, any unhandled exception and print them

## V5 - Obtain testability (Port/Adapter architectural style)

Apply Dependency Inversion Principle and Dependency Injection to our application

- Define ports for planet, rover and commands source
- Implement port adapters
- Define injectable application
- Use test doubles in test suite

## V6 - Obtain testability (Elm-ish architectural style)

Use values to obtain a strong and simple separation between domain and infrastructure logic

- implement init, update and test them without infrastructure and mocks
- implement infrastructure and test it with integration tests
